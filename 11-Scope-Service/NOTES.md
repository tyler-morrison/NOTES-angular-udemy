# The Scope Service

One of the most important concepts in AngularJS is *scope*. Scope is a big part of the thing that binds the model to the view — **it’s an object that is part of the Scope Service.** It involves dependency injection.

Within AngularJS the `$scope` object — a native service — is automatically defined. **All AngularJS services begin with a ‘$’ so that they’re easy to recognize.**

The scope becomes the middle piece between the view an the controller.
