# Getting Other Services

There are lots of built-in services that can be used within Angular. You can view them [here](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service).

To inject any service, you simply have to include its name within the controller. **Donâ€™t write your own code if a similar service already exists.**

Aside from the base services that come directly with Angular, there are many other [modules](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/angular.js/1.5.5) that contain additional services. To use them, you need to do the following...

1. Download or link to the desired module within your HTML.
2. Then add it to the dependencies of your main app module.
